summary: I devised an eye-tracker setup and developed the helper module for pupil-labs products in Python (published on PyPI and Github) as a part of the near-eye display project. To reduce the form factor, We implemented our own calibration without the World Camera of Eye tracker, which is eliminated to reduce the form-factor. To calibrate eye-tracker data, we collect some data before the main measurements based on prepared target and then process it with K-mean clustering and affine transform.

  <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
  <br>
  I devised an eye-tracker setup and developed the helper module for pupil-labs products in Python (published on
  <a class=aboutme href=https://pypi.org/project/pypupil>PyPI</a> and
  <a class=aboutme href=https://github.com/choisuyeon/pypupil>Github</a>)
  as a part of the near-eye display project. To reduce the form factor of the near-eye display,
  We implemented our own calibration without the World Camera of Eye tracker, which is eliminated to reduce the form-factor. To calibrate eye-tracker data, we collect some data before the main measurements based on prepared target and then process it with K-mean clustering and affine transform. The results are shown on the right.
