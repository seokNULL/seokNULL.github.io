summary: Near-eye displays with focus cues attracts a lot of attention from display society since they can provide more immersive and comfort experience. However, there are several challenging issues &#58; contrast, form factor, and frame rate. Here, we conceived a novel prototype that supports a large number of layers within the wide depth of field. This system could provide semi-original contrast, large depth of field, and quasi-continuous focus cues at 60fps. We believe this approach could open a new possibility for near-eye displays for representation of continuous depth.

  <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
  <br>
  Currently, commercial head-mounted displays suer from limited accommodative states, which lead to vergence-accommodation conflict. In this work, we newly design the architecture of head-mounted display supporting 15 focal planes over wide depth ofeld (20cm-optical infinity) in real time to alleviate vergence-accommodation conflict. Our system employs a low-resolution vertical scanning backlight, a display panel (e.g. liquid crystal panel), and focus-tunable lens. We demonstrate the compact prototype and verify its performance through experimental results.ÃŸ
