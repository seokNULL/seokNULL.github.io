abstract = {There have been many recent developments in 3D display technology to provide correct accommodation cues over an extended focus range. To this end, those displays rely on scene decomposition algorithms to reproduce accurate occlusion boundaries as well asretinal defocus blur. Recently, tomographic displays have been proposed with improved trade-offs of focus range, spatial resolution, and exit-pupil. The advantage of the system partly stems from a high-speed backlight modulation system based on a digital micromirror device, which only supports 1-bit images. However, its inherent binary constraint hinders achieving the optimal scene decomposition, thus leaving boundary artifacts. In this work, we present a technique for synthesizing optimal imagery of general 3D scenes with occlusion on tomographic displays. Requiring no prior knowledge of the scene geometry, our technique addresses the blending issue via non-convex optimization, inspired by recent studies in discrete tomography. Also, we present a general framework for this rendering algorithm and demonstrate the utility of the technique for volumetric display systems with binary representation.},
